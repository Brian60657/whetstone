# Whetstone

> Whetstone is a web application that new and experienced developers can use to hone their skills and expand their programming vocabulary.

> Built by [Brian](https://github.com/Brian60657), [James](https://github.com/JMEssex), [Gus](https://github.com/gnordhielm), and [Matt](https://github.com/mld78) - the CRUD Studs.

### Installation 

> No app yet, no instructions yet. You'll probably have to `npm install`.

### Technologies Used

Whetstone is a **Node.js** app which uses **express** and **mongoDB**, mediated by **mongoose**. It will also make use of the **ejs** library and **jQuery**'s ajax methods to make its pages dynamic and connect with the internal API. It will connect with one of two APIs - **HackerEarth** or **programmr** - which will allow Whetstone to evaluate code written by users online. User authentication will be implemented with **passport**, using the **Facebook** OAuth strategy. 

### Process

Our **minimum viable product** will...

* Be deployed on Heroku, accessible to anyone.
* Have a sign-up page, which allows anyone to create a secure account.
* Have at least **five** exercises in **JavaScript**.
* Have a profile page, where an authenticated user can see which exercises they have completed.
* Make exercises accessible to developers via a simple API.
* Store user information and exercises using mongoDB
