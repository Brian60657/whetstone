        <p>Whetstone was established in 2017 as an alternative to the Codewars and Codecademy websites.  Our vision is to provide you with more of a foundation to help you learn to code.  We have broken down sprints into various topics of focus such as the .Map and Math. objects in JavaScript so you may specifically hone in and master a skill.</p><br>
